"# Portfolio" 
Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Sornali Akter, a dedicated and enthusiastic Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in designing and developing robust, user-friendly web and mobile applications. I specialize in ASP.NET (C#) for backend development and Angular and React for building responsive and dynamic frontends. With a passion for clean code and modern design, I aim to create impactful digital experiences that solve real-world problems.

I have recently completed a 788-hour professional training under the IsDB-BISEW IT Scholarship Programme, where I built several full stack projects from the ground up. Some highlights include a Hospital Management System and an Online Shopping System, showcasing my ability to handle complex features like role-based access, real-time scheduling, and secure payment processing. These projects demonstrate my skills in working with relational databases, RESTful APIs, component-based UI development, and integrating frontend and backend systems seamlessly.

My technical toolkit includes:

Frontend: Angular, React, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, TypeScript

Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework

Database: SQL Server

Tools: Visual Studio, VS Code, Git, Postman

What sets me apart is my eagerness to learn, my attention to detail, and my ability to work both independently and in teams. I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to real-world software development, grow with experienced professionals, and make a meaningful impact through code.
